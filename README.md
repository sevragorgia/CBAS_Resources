# CBAS Resources

This is an umbrella repository for the data we generate on the **Common Blue Aquarium Sponge (CBAS)**. It contain pointers to other repositories with data on this system.

Note that these other repositories are independently mantained and that this repository use the submodule capability of git to pull those repositories and the most recent changes push to them.

The goal of this repository is to provide a users with one single repository that can be cloned and from which all information generated on CBAS can be easily fetched and kept together.

I hope this makes sense, and it makes your lives easier.

cheers

Sergio
